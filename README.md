# Description 

Remove messages from tamo.lt portal inbox, one by one Browser console script.

Portal has no functionality to mark delete all. 
Messages by the subject seen as not important never opened and after couple of years shown as +300 unread.

As there is no other way to clean up, wrote this script to help.

# Usage

Open Tamo, go to Inbox. Browser console mode paste the code (pasting by default not allowed - read instructions).


# Customisation

Click interval set to 2000ms (2s). Works on 1500, but dependant on connection an response time 2s safe.

 By default making 20 clicks -> 20 messages. Adopt to your needs.
